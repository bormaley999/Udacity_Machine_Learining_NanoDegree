# Detecting Payment Card Fraud

This repository contains code and associated files for deploying ML models using AWS SageMaker. This repository consists of a number of tutorial notebooks for various case studies, code exercises, and project files that will be to illustrate parts of the ML workflow and give you practice deploying a variety of ML algorithms.

## Project Description

Detaild project descroption could be found in the Project Notebook in the current folder.
In this section, we'll look at a credit card fraud detection dataset, and build a binary classification model that can identify transactions as either fraudulent or valid, based on provided, *historical* data. In a [2016 study](https://nilsonreport.com/upload/content_promo/The_Nilson_Report_10-17-2016.pdf), it was estimated that credit card fraud was responsible for over 20 billion dollars in loss, worldwide. Accurately detecting cases of fraud is an ongoing area of research.

<br> [Payment Fraud Detection](https://github.com/udacity/ML_SageMaker_Studies/tree/master/Payment_Fraud_Detection): Learn how to build and deploy a supervised, LinearLearner model in SageMaker. You'll tune a model and handle a case of class imbalance to train a model to detect cases of credit card fraud.

## Labeled Data

The payment fraud data set (Dal Pozzolo et al. 2015) was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data). This has features and labels for thousands of credit card transactions, each of which is labeled as fraudulent or valid. In this notebook, we'd like to train a model based on the features of these transactions so that we can predict risky or fraudulent transactions in the future.


## Setup Instructions

The notebooks provided in this repository are intended to be executed using Amazon's SageMaker platform. Also, in order to reproduce the code in Notebook, please, refer to the original source of the project section.
