# Udacity Machine Learning NanoDegre Project 1 | imbB Sentiment Analysis Project using RNN based on PyTorch

The notebook and Python files provided here, once completed, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews.

Please see the [README](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment/tree/master/README.md) from Udacity's main folder for instructions on setting up a SageMaker notebook and downloading the project files (as well as the other notebooks).

# Dependacies 

To run the project you need to download the Index.html file and run it in a browser. However, before you begin you have to ask me to turn-on Sagemaker's API endpoint to execute the project; this is because the project is hosting on AWS. Hence, I will do that for an interview or review process only. 

If you would like to have fun playing around with this project you have to set up AWS instance for yourself. The description of how to do that is presented in the README file above. Alternatively, you could check sagemaker-deployment (https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment) folder I forked from Udacity.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope it was useful for you.
