# Udacity_Machine_Learining_NanoDegree

Welcome to my Udacity Machine Learning NanoDegree workbench. I will store my portfolio projects here. 

## Structure 
The IMDb Sentimenent Analysis Project Using Pytorch and RNN could be found [here](https://github.com/bormaley999/Udacity_Machine_Learining_NanoDegree/tree/master/Udacity_Machine_Learining_NanoDegree/imbD%20Sentiment%20Analysis) the reason for folder's devision is simple - each folder represents a standalone project. 
The link to [README](https://github.com/bormaley999/Udacity_Machine_Learining_NanoDegree/blob/master/Udacity_Machine_Learining_NanoDegree/imbD%20Sentiment%20Analysis/README.md) file about the IMDb Sentiment Analysis Project using PyTorch - this is the first project in the course.

Also, it is important to note that in order to run some projects (e.g. IMDb Sentimenent Analysis), I have to run turn-on AWS Sagemaker API which is costly, so I will do that ONLY for an interview or review processes only.

If you would like to have fun playing around with this project you have to set up AWS instance for yourself. The description of how to do that is presented in the README file above. Alternatively, you could check sagemaker-deployment (https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment) folder I forked from Udacity.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope it was useful for you.
