# Moon Data Classification \ Deploying Custom PyTorch Model

In this notebook, you'll employ two, unsupervised learning algorithms to do **population segmentation**. Population segmentation aims to find natural groupings in population data that reveal some feature-level similarities between different regions in the US.


The notebook will be broken down into a few steps:
* Generating the moon data
* Loading it into an S3 bucket
* Defining a PyTorch binary classifier
* Completing a training script
* Training and deploying the custom model
* Evaluating its performance


**The original source for the project**
[Deploy a Custom PyTorch Model (Moon Data)](https://github.com/udacity/ML_SageMaker_Studies/tree/master/Moon_Data): Train and deploy a custom PyTorch neural network that classifies "moon" data; binary data distributed in moon-like shapes.

## Setup Instructions

The notebooks provided in this repository are intended to be executed using Amazon's SageMaker platform.
